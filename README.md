## Install from source
0. Get [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Info
- The app basically opens the Discord Developer Portal, where you can choose or create a Rich Presence application, with a live preview.
- Press the `X` button to minimise to the tray, and there you can exit the app or reopen the window by right clicking.

## To-do
- Add (disableable) notifications to indicate that the app has been minimised to the tray.
- Compile into executables for easier installation and convenience.
